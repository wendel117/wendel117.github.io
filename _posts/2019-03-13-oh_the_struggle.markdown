I love starting things! It is always so exciting, and I feel so motivated. This was no different. I was ready to start something that would positively impact my life so much. But like most things I start, that excitement does wear off eventually. I had a great first month, felt like I was understanding everything super easily and quickly, really loved the labs, and was ahead of schedule. Then I hit a wall. This wall was called flu season. My entire family got the flu, one at a time. Three weeks straight of caring for others around the clock, with little time for school. Finally, I was able to get back to my schedule, but felt like I lost my train of thought. Things weren't coming easily to me, I felt like I missed lessons and had all these gaps where information should be.

I am getting through slowly but surely however, and am commited and determined to conquer this. I feel like I am easily grasping the higher level concepts, such as overall views of classes, how class methods and instance methods work, and readers/writers etc... However, when I get to a lab, I swear I feel like I'm stupid and feel like I have no idea how to program the block of code within an instance method in order to get what I need. That's stuff that was covered weeks ago!! I keep saying to myself "wait, how was I supposed to know that?" "We never learned that, I can't know these things if I'm not taught these things!". 

And that's where I think things started going wrong. I was rolling along so quickly and easily that I wasn't needing to reach outside of the core curriculum to find information and learn. I wasn't "living code". I wasn't turning to the vast amount of Ruby information out there to fill out my knowledge I had from our lessons. I also wasn't taking advantage of the live discussions or study groups. Biggest mistake ever! I'm not super fond of being put on the spot, so I had shied away from joining any sessions where I could be called on, even though they aren't even in person!! 

Now I feel like I'm in a better place. I am still way off course, pretty far behind where I want to be, but I'm allowing myself the time I need to build up my understanding of things so that instead of finding the solution and thinking to myself "hey that does make sense now that it is in front of me," I'm actually thinking of it myself first.
